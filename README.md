# React Webpack Boilerplate

Use this boilerplate if you don't want to implement CRA in your project.
It uses React and it is bundled with Webpack.

## How to get started

You just have to install the dependencies, just run:
`npm install`

Then just run the development server
`npm run dev`

## How to build

Install the dependencies of the project running:
`npm install`

Then just run the following command:
`npm run build`

By default build is going to be stored in _./build folder_, you can modify this setting in **webpack.common.js** file.

Be aware that this boilerplate doesn't implement any kind of Testing library, or a way to test your application, if you want a boilerplate which implements this feature, please refer to:
